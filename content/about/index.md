title: "About Me"
description: "An engineer's journey, from modeling oceans to building low-level systems."
---

I'm a software engineer based in Paris, with roots in Vietnam and a background in computational marine science. I speak English, French, and Vietnamese, and I'm passionate about building and understanding complex systems. You can find my full resume [here](/ThamLE_resume.pdf), see my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tham-le), or contact me at [thamle.work@gmail.com](mailto:thamle.work@gmail.com). Outside of work, I enjoy CTF competitions, reading source code, and exploring the math behind computer graphics.

## My Journey: From Ocean Science to Code

My path into technology didn't start with a computer, but with the ocean. As a scientist at Aix-Marseille University and later at LSCE-CNRS, I specialized in modeling the distribution of mercury in marine ecosystems. I used complex climate datasets and mathematical models to understand large-scale systems.

That's where I had my "aha" moment. I realized I was spending more time optimizing my Python data-processing pipelines than analyzing the results themselves. I was more fascinated by *building* the tool than by the measurement it produced. It was this curiosity for the underlying mechanics that led me to software engineering.

I found my footing at **42 Paris**, an intense, lecture-free learning environment where the only way to learn is to build, break, and collaborate. It was there that I got to dive deep into C/C++ systems programming, algorithms, and fundamental problem-solving.

Today, I continue that journey as an engineer. Every project is a new opportunity to understand a complex system, whether it's by optimizing a graphical render, securing a web application, or porting C++ code to new platforms.

## Other Interests

### **CTF Competitions**
I participate in CTFs to learn applied security concepts in a hands-on way. It's a practical method for understanding web security, cryptography, and binary exploitation. I maintain a repository of my writeups.

### **Reading Code**
I learn a lot from reading the source code of open-source projects. It's the best way to see how experienced engineers solve real-world problems.
