I'm a software engineer based in Paris, with roots in Vietnam and a background in computational marine science. I speak English, French, and Vietnamese, and I'm passionate about building and understanding complex systems. You can find my full resume [here](/thamle_resume.pdf), see my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tham-le), or contact me at [thamle.work@gmail.com](mailto:thamle.work@gmail.com). Outside of work, I enjoy sharpening my security skills in CTF competitions and building impactful applications at hackathons.

## My Journey: From Ocean Science to Code

My path into technology didn't start with a computer, but with the ocean. As a scientist student at Aix-Marseille University and later at LSCE-CEA, I specialized in physical and chemical oceanography, especially in modeling the distribution of mercury in marine ecosystems. I used complex climate datasets and mathematical models to understand large-scale systems and climate change evolution.

That's where I had my "aha" moment. I realized I always liked to take classes that use programming and wanted to build the tools myself. It was this curiosity for the underlying mechanics that led me to software engineering.

I found my place at **42 Paris**, an intense, lecture-free learning environment where the only way to learn is to build, break, and collaborate. It was there that I got to dive deep into C/C++ systems programming, algorithms, and fundamental problem-solving by building projects like network servers, graphics engines, and containerized web services from the ground up.

Today, I continue that journey as an engineer. Every project is a new opportunity to understand a complex system, whether it's by optimizing a graphical render, securing a web application, or writing C++ code to protect user data.

## Experience

### **C++ Development Engineer at Snowpack**

*August 2024 â€“ July 2025*

> [Snowpack](https://snowpack.eu/) develops an innovative solution to protect user data with a VIPN (Virtual & Invisible Private Network), transforming data into "snowflakes" to make users invisible online.

**Missions:**

* Led the effort to port Snowpack's C++ SDK to run in browsers using **WebAssembly (Wasm)**, successfully creating a proof-of-concept that validated cross-platform feature deployment.
* Ensured software quality by developing test suites and performing rigorous testing across diverse platforms (Android, macOS, ARM64), identifying critical bugs to accelerate their resolution.
* Improved the command-line tool's usability and security by implementing features like robust MFA handling, service listing, and a memory-safe log rotation strategy.
* Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop and specify user data consumption tracking (without knowing the user data's content of course) features across C++, Android, and iOS applications.

### **Research Intern at LSCE-CNRS**

*February 2021 â€“ August 2021*

> The LSCE is a leading research laboratory focused on climate and environmental sciences.

**Missions:**

* Contributed to global climate research by developing and adding new modules in FORTRAN to IPCC-class climate models, used to analyze mercury distribution in marine ecosystems.
* Processed very large datasets using Python, an experience that taught me the critical importance of clean code and reproducible results in scientific research.

## Technical Skills

* **Systems & Backend Programming:** C, C++, Python (FastAPI, Django), REST APIs
* **Web & Frontend:** JavaScript, React
* **Systems & DevOps:** Linux, Docker, Git, CI/CD
* **Cybersecurity:** Secure coding practices, vulnerability analysis

## Education

### **42 Paris - Software Engineering**

*2022 â€“ 2025*

* Ranked Top 10 in the 'piscine' selection round (out of 500+ candidates) and finished the Common Core curriculum in the Top 20 (out of 800+).
* Project-based curriculum focused on C/C++, system programming, and algorithms.
* Learned by building, debugging, and collaborating. No formal classes.
* Served as a C programming tutor.

### **Aix-Marseille University - M.Sc, Marine Science**

*2019 â€“ 2021*

* Specialized in computational oceanography and mathematical modeling.
* Used Python, R, and Fortran for data analysis.

## Other Interests

### **CTF Competitions**

I participate in CTFs to learn applied security concepts in a hands-on way. It's a practical method for understanding web security, cryptography, and binary exploitation. I maintain a repository of my writeups [here](https://github.com/tham-le/CTF-Writeups).

### **Hackathons**

I enjoy participating in hackathons to rapidly build solutions for real-world problems. I've worked on projects related to health tech (DigHacktion) and women's health (InnovHer), and participated in hardware-focused events like the Google Hardware Hackathon.
