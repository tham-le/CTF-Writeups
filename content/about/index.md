# About Me

## From Ocean Research to Code

I started in ocean science, modeling mercury distribution in marine ecosystems. What drew me to software engineering was the same thing that made me love research: the satisfaction of understanding complex systems and building solutions that work.

The transition wasn't planned. During my research at LSCE-CNRS, I spent more time optimizing data processing pipelines than analyzing results. That's when I realized I was more interested in how the tools worked than what they measured.

## Current Work

### **C++ Development Engineer at Snowpack** 
*August 2024 – July 2025*

Working on a C++ SDK that needs to run everywhere. Key things I've learned:

- **WebAssembly Integration**: Porting C++ to run in browsers. Understanding the constraints taught me about memory management and optimization.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Making code work on Android, macOS, and ARM64. Every platform breaks in different ways.
- **Developer Tools**: Building CLI tools that don't frustrate users. Good UX matters even for developer tools.

*"Tham proves she has the necessary level to join the professional world as a software engineer."* — Martin Parisot, Engineering Lead

### **Research at LSCE-CNRS** 
*February 2021 – August 2021*

Built Python models for global mercury distribution using IPCC climate data. This is where I learned that good code is just as important as good science. Automated data processing reduced analysis time significantly and made results reproducible.

## Technical Skills

**Languages I work with daily:** C++, Python  
**Languages I use when needed:** JavaScript, C, SQL, Bash

**What I've built things with:**
- Backend: Django, FastAPI, REST APIs
- Frontend: React, Vue.js, basic Three.js
- Database: PostgreSQL, some Redis
- Systems: Docker, Linux, Git, CI/CD

**Areas I'm actively learning:**
- Performance optimization and profiling
- WebAssembly and cross-platform development
- Secure coding practices
- System architecture patterns

## Education

### **42 Paris - Software Engineering Program**
*2022 – June 2025*

Project-based learning without traditional courses. You learn by doing, failing, and figuring out solutions. Ranked in top 10 during entrance (500+ candidates) and top 20 in core curriculum.

**Teaching:** Official tutor for C programming. Explaining concepts to others helps me understand them better.

### **Aix-Marseille University - Marine Science M.Sc**
*2019 – 2021*

Computational oceanography focused on mathematical modeling. Used Python, R, and Fortran for data analysis. This background helps me think systematically about complex problems.

## Security & Continuous Learning

### **CTF Competitions**
I participate in capture-the-flag events because they force you to think creatively about systems. Each challenge teaches something new:

- **Web Security**: How applications break and how to prevent it
- **Cryptography**: Mathematics meets practical security
- **Binary Exploitation**: Understanding what happens under the hood
- **OSINT**: Information gathering and correlation

**Recent competitions:** HeroCTF v6, IrisCTF, HTB University CTF, CyberApocalypse 2025

### **Ongoing Learning**
- Google Cybersecurity Certificate (January 2025)
- Various hackathons and workshops
- Reading source code of projects I find interesting

## Projects & Interests

**Fractol:** Multi-threaded fractal renderer in C. Learned about parallel processing, memory optimization, and graphics programming. The math is beautiful, the bugs were educational.

**CTF Writeups:** Document solutions to security challenges. Writing explanations helps me understand the concepts better and maybe helps others learn too.

**Web Applications:** Built several full-stack projects. Each one teaches something about architecture, databases, or user experience.

## What Motivates Me

I enjoy the process of figuring out how things work. Whether it's debugging a segmentation fault, optimizing a slow query, or understanding why a crypto algorithm is secure, the investigation is what I find engaging.

I prefer learning through building rather than just reading about concepts. Making mistakes and fixing them teaches more than perfect examples.

Good software makes complex things simple for users. That requires understanding both the technical constraints and human needs.

## Currently

Based in Paris, working on improving my understanding of systems programming and software architecture. Always interested in projects where I can learn something new while building something useful.
