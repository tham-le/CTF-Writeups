## About Me

I'm a software engineer who enjoys solving problems. My background is in computational ocean science, where I learned to love modeling complex systems. I transitioned to software engineering because I found myself more interested in building the tools for research than running them.

This site is a collection of my work and a log of what I'm learning.

## Professional Experience

### **C++ Development Engineer, Snowpack**
*August 2024 – July 2025*
- Developed a cross-platform C++ SDK.
- Worked on WebAssembly (Wasm) bindings to run native code in the browser.
- Implemented and maintained testing suites for Android, macOS, and ARM64 environments.
- Built and improved CLI tools for developers.

### **Research Intern, LSCE-CNRS**
*February 2021 – August 2021*
- Built Python models to analyze global mercury distribution using IPCC climate data.
- Automated data processing pipelines, which taught me the value of reproducible results and clean code in a scientific context.

## Other Interests

### **CTF Competitions**
I participate in CTFs to learn applied security concepts in a hands-on way. It's a practical method for understanding web security, cryptography, and binary exploitation. I maintain a repository of my writeups.

### **Reading Code**
I learn a lot from reading the source code of open-source projects. It's the best way to see how experienced engineers solve real-world problems.
