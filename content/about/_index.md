> — **Martin Parisot, Snowpack**

## Background & Journey

As a Software Engineer, I bring a unique perspective from my background in computational oceanography and my training at 42 Paris. I enjoy working with Python for its uses in data science and web development, and C++ for its power in high-performance computing and system-level tasks. This background helps me think algorithmically and focus on optimization, whether I'm building complex systems or working with data.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and apply my skills to create solid, efficient solutions. I aim to contribute to challenging projects where I can use my adaptability and technical skills.

## My Approach to Software Development

My journey has given me a broad approach to engineering:

- **Analytical & Mathematical Skills**: Good at solving complex problems using skills from scientific modeling (Python, R, Fortran).
- **Performance Focus**: Experienced in making code (especially C++) run faster for large datasets and heavy tasks.
- **Adaptable Problem-Solving**: Good at turning abstract ideas into working software, using Python for quick tests or C++ for speed.
- **Wide Range of Skills**: Comfortable with low-level system programming (C/C++) and high-level application development (Python, JavaScript).

## Technical Skills

**Languages**: C++ (STL, Modern C++), Python (Scientific Stack, Web Frameworks), C, JavaScript, Bash, SQL  
**Frameworks & Libraries**: Django, Three.js, React, Vue.js, (Pandas, NumPy - if relevant)  
**Developer Tools**: Git, Docker, Linux/UNIX, CMake, GDB/Valgrind, MiniLibX, pthreads, WebSockets, CI/CD  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, MariaDB  
**Core Concepts**: System Programming, Network Programming (TCP/IP), Performance Optimization, OOP, Multithreading, Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Development (Full-Stack), Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Professional Experience

### C++ Development Engineer

**Snowpack, Palaiseau** | *August 2024 – July 2025*

- Led efforts to update the C++ SDK by building a successful WebAssembly (WASM) test version, showing core SDK features could run in web browsers.
- Developed tools for C++, Android, and iOS to accurately track user data use; also wrote key plans for setting data limits based on user subscription levels.
- Ensured software quality by thoroughly testing beta releases on multiple platforms (Android, macOS, ARM64); found and reported critical bugs quickly, helping to get them fixed faster.
- Improved the command line tool with strong MFA and easy ways for users to see their services; also set up better log management to save memory and help with bug reports.
- Collaborated effectively within a multicultural, English-speaking engineering team to achieve shared development goals and meet release objectives.

### Research Intern

**LSCE - CNRS & CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette** | *February 2021 – August 2021*

- Modeled mercury distribution in oceans using IPCC climate models (Python, Fortran), contributing to global pollution research.
- Automated Python data processing pipelines for oceanic mercury predictions, enhancing research efficiency.

## Cybersecurity & CTF Engagement

I enjoy exploring cybersecurity by participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. These challenges cover areas like web security, cryptography, and binary exploitation, helping me learn practical defensive and offensive security skills.
