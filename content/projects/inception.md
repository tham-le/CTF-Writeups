## Overview

Multi-container Docker infrastructure with WordPress

## Project Details

# Inception - Docker-based Web Infrastructure

This project demonstrates a sophisticated web infrastructure setup using Docker containers, showcasing system administration and containerization skills. The infrastructure runs a WordPress site with MariaDB database, Redis caching, and Nginx as a reverse proxy, all orchestrated using Docker Compose.

## ðŸŽ¬ Why "Inception"?

The name "Inception" is inspired by the concept of "a dream within a dream" from Christopher Nolan's movie. In this project, we create multiple layers of virtualization:

1. **First Layer**: A Linux Alpine virtual machine
2. **Second Layer**: Docker containers running inside the VM
3. **Third Layer**: Services (WordPress, MariaDB, etc.) running inside the containers

This nested virtualization approach demonstrates advanced system administration concepts and containerization techniques, making it a perfect example of "infrastructure within infrastructure" - hence the name "Inception".

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Containerized Services**:
  - Nginx web server with SSL support
  - WordPress CMS
  - MariaDB database
  - Redis caching system
- **Secure Configuration**:
  - SSL/TLS encryption
  - Environment variable management
  - Persistent data storage
- **Docker Best Practices**:
  - Custom Dockerfile configurations
  - Volume management for data persistence
  - Container networking
  - Health checks and automatic restarts
