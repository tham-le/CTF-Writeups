## Project Details

# Piscine python for data science

This repository contains a series of Python projects organized into modules, designed to progressively build data science skills.  It follows a "piscine" style of learning, where each module focuses on a particular aspect of Python and its application to data science.

## Modules Overview

### Python-0-Starting: Introduction to Python Basics

This module covers the fundamentals of Python programming:

*   **ex00/Hello.py:** Introduces basic Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) and their mutability.
*   **ex01/format_ft_time.py:** Demonstrates how to work with time, including formatting and scientific notation.
*   **ex02/find_ft_type.py:** Shows how to determine the type of a Python object.
*   **ex03/NULL_not_found.py:**  Explores handling of NULL values and other special data types (NaN, empty strings, False, 0).
*   **ex04/whatis.py:**  Uses command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and exception handling to determine if a number is even or odd.
*   **ex05/building.py:**  Performs string manipulation to count characters (uppercase, lowercase, punctuation, spaces, digits).  Handles user input and potential errors (EOFError).
*   **ex06/filterstring.py:** Filters words in a string based on length, using a custom `ft_filter` function and lambda expressions.
*   **ex06/ft_filter.py:**  Implements a custom filter function, mimicking the built-in `filter` function.
*   **ex07/sos.py:** Encodes a string into Morse code using a dictionary.
*   **ex08/Loading.py:** Creates a custom progress bar (`ft_tqdm`) using `sys.stdout.write` and `os.get_terminal_size`.
*   **ex09/usage.py:** Demonstrates the usage of the `ft_package`.
*   **ex09/ft_package/:**  Contains a simple Python package with a single function (`count_in_list`) to count the occurrences of an item in a list. Includes `pyproject.toml` for building the package.

### Python-1-Array: Working with Arrays and Image Manipulation

This module focuses on using NumPy arrays and basic image processing with `matplotlib`:

*   **ex00/give_bmi.py:** Calculates BMI from lists of height and weight, with error handling.  Includes a function to apply a limit and return a boolean array.
*   **ex01/array2D.py:** Slices a 2D array (represented as a list of lists) and prints its shape, mimicking NumPy array slicing.
*   **ex02/load_image.py:** Loads an image using `matplotlib.image` and prints its shape.  Basic error handling.
