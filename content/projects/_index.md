# Projects

These are things I've built while learning different technologies and solving problems. Each project taught me something new about programming, system design, or problem-solving.

The projects are automatically synced from my GitHub repositories, so you're seeing the actual code I write and maintain.

## Learning Areas

**Systems Programming** - Working with C/C++, memory management, and performance optimization

**Web Development** - Full-stack applications, APIs, and user interfaces

**Security & CTF** - Tools and solutions for cybersecurity challenges

**Graphics & Visualization** - Mathematical rendering and interactive applications

*Projects are loaded dynamically from GitHub. If you don't see any below, the sync might be running or there could be an API issue.*
