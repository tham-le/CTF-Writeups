## Overview

Linux_from_scatch

## Project Details

# ft_linux - How to Train Your Kernel

> Build a basic, but functional, Linux distribution from scratch

## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves building a complete Linux distribution from the ground up, including compiling the kernel, installing essential packages, and configuring the system.

## 🎯 Main Goals

- [ ] Build a Linux Kernel
- [ ] Install essential binaries (see package list below)
- [ ] Implement a filesystem hierarchy compliant with standards
- [ ] Connect to the Internet

## 📚 Resources

- **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** - The Bible for building Linux from scratch
- **Kernel Documentation** - Official Linux kernel documentation
- **GNU Autotools** - For building packages from source
- Online tutorials and step-by-step guides for custom kernel building

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Virtual Machine (VirtualBox, VMWare, or QEMU recommended)
- [ ] Host system with development tools
- [ ] Stable internet connection for downloading sources

### Technical Specifications

- [ ] **Kernel Version**: Must use Linux kernel 4.x (stable or development)
- [ ] **Architecture**: Choose between 32-bit or 64-bit system
- [ ] **Kernel Sources Location**: `/usr/src/kernel-$(version)`
- [ ] **Kernel Version Format**: `Linux kernel 4.x.x-<student_login>`
- [ ] **Hostname**: Set to your student login
- [ ] **Kernel Binary**: `/boot/vmlinuz-<linux_version>-<student_login>`

### Partitioning Requirements

- [ ] **Root partition** (/)
- [ ] **Boot partition** (/boot)
- [ ] **Swap partition**
- [ ] Additional partitions (optional but recommended)

### System Components

- [ ] **Kernel Module Loader**: udev or equivalent
- [ ] **Init System**: SysV or SystemD
