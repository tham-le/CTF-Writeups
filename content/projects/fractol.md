## Project Overview

`Fractol` is a fractal visualization tool written in C. It uses the MinilibX graphics library for rendering and POSIX threads (pthreads) to accelerate calculations. The goal was to build a performant renderer while learning about graphics programming, concurrency, and numerical algorithms.

This project is an extension of the original 42 School assignment. It includes additional features beyond the base requirements.

## Key Features & Implementation Details

-   **Fractal Sets**: Implements rendering for Mandelbrot, Julia, and Newton sets, plus a Barnsley Fern.
-   **Multi-threaded Rendering**: Uses pthreads to parallelize the fractal calculations across multiple CPU cores. This significantly reduces render times, especially for high-iteration images. I implemented a work-stealing queue model where threads pull rows of pixels to compute.
-   **Coloring Algorithms**: Implemented smooth coloring based on the iteration count to produce continuous gradients, which provides more detail than simple banding.
-   **Image Export**: The rendered fractal can be exported to BMP format.
-   **User Interaction**: The view is interactive, allowing zooming and panning to explore the fractals.

## Technical Challenges

-   **Concurrency**: Synchronizing threads to render different parts of the image without race conditions or deadlocks was a key challenge.
-   **Performance Optimization**: I spent time profiling the code to identify bottlenecks in the calculation loop and memory allocation.
-   **Graphics Programming**: Working with a low-level graphics library like MinilibX requires manual management of the frame buffer, event handling, and color representation.
