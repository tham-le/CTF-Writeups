## Project Details

# EMA: Personalized Health Management for Rheumatism

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

EMA (named after the mother of the creator, Andrea) is a comprehensive health management application designed to assist individuals suffering from rheumatic conditions.  It provides personalized daily tracking, dietary planning, activity recommendations, and symptom analysis, leveraging a scientifically-backed approach to improve quality of life. The application combines a Flask-based RESTful backend (Python) with a modern, responsive Vue 3 frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## Project Overview

EMA's core functionality revolves around helping users manage their rheumatic condition by:

*   **Tracking Pain & Mood:** Users can record their daily pain levels, pain types (articular, muscular, inflammatory, stiffness, fatigue, swelling), and mood, along with detailed notes.
*   **Personalized Meal Planning:**  The application generates weekly meal plans tailored to the user's profile, featuring anti-inflammatory recipes (focused on the Mediterranean diet) with ingredients like fatty fish, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fresh fruits/vegetables.  The meal plans include breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.
*   **Shopping List Generation:**  EMA automatically creates a shopping list based on the user's weekly meal plan, consolidating ingredients and quantities.  The shopping list includes a feature to mark items as purchased (with persistence using `localStorage`).
*   **Activity Logging:** Users can track their physical activities, with examples provided (running, yoga, swimming, strength training, stationary biking). YouTube video links are included for some activities.
*   **Microbiote Information:** A dedicated page provides information about the human intestinal microbiome, including its composition, functions, and impact on health.
*   **Detailed Pathology Tracking:** A "Pathologie" page allows users to log their daily pain levels, select pain types, and add detailed notes.  The app displays a history chart of pain levels.
*   **User Profile Management:** Users can manage their personal information (username, email, first name, last name, age, gender) and health information (height, weight, primary health condition, diagnosis status, allergies, medications).
* **Recipe invalidation**: A user can click on a button to invalidate a recipe and give a reason.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** (Currently, user ID 1 is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.  Full authentication is not yet implemented.)
*   **Pain & Mood Tracking:** Daily recording of pain level, type, and description; mood recording with description.
*   **Meal Planning:**
    *   Weekly meal plan generation with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
    *   Recipes based on an anti-inflammatory diet.
    *   Recipe details view (ingredients, instructions).
    *   Ability to switch between daily and weekly views.
    *  Shopping list feature.
    * Recipe Invalidity.
