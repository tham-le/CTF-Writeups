# CTF Write-up Directory Structure Generator
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script creates a directory structure for your CTF write-ups.
# It uses two data blocks:
#   1. SOLVED_CHALLENGES: A list of the challenges you solved.
#   2. ALL_CHALLENGES_INFO: A table with metadata for all challenges.
#
# The script will only create folders for the challenges listed in
# SOLVED_CHALLENGES.
#

# --- Configuration ---
# Name of the root folder for this CTF.
CTF_NAME="MyCTF_Writeups"
