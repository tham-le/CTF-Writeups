# CTF Writeups

I participate in Capture The Flag competitions to learn about cybersecurity. Each challenge teaches something new about how systems work, how they break, and how to secure them.

These writeups document my thought process and solutions. Writing them helps me solidify what I learned and hopefully helps others learn too.

## What I Learn From

**Web Exploitation** - Understanding how web applications can be attacked and defended

**Cryptography** - Applied mathematics in security contexts

**Binary Exploitation** - Low-level system understanding and memory management

**Digital Forensics** - Investigation techniques and data analysis

**OSINT** - Information gathering and correlation from public sources

*Writeups are organized from my CTF-Writeups repository submodule. Each competition gets its own section with individual challenge solutions.*
