Welcome to my digital garden - a living collection of notes, thoughts, and learning materials that I maintain in Obsidian. This space contains:

- **Technical concepts** and explanations
- **Learning notes** from various topics  
- **Reference materials** and documentation
- **Interconnected thoughts** with backlinks

These notes are part of my continuous learning process and are organized in a way that promotes discovery and connection between ideas.
