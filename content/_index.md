# Hi, I'm Tham

## Learning Through Building

I came to software engineering from ocean science, bringing curiosity about how complex systems work. What started as analyzing marine data led me to discovering I genuinely enjoy solving problems through code.

Currently in Paris, I work primarily with **Python** and **C++**. At **Snowpack**, I got hands-on experience with WebAssembly and cross-platform development, learning how to make code work across different environments.

**What interests me:** Taking apart complex problems, understanding why things work (or don't), and building solutions that actually help.

## What I'm Working On

**🔧 Systems Programming**  
Learning performance optimization and memory management through C++ projects. Each bug teaches me something new about how computers actually work.

**🛡️ Security Research**  
Active in CTF competitions because they force you to think like both builder and breaker. Every challenge is a lesson in secure coding.

**🌐 Full-Stack Development**  
Building complete applications helps me understand the entire pipeline from database to user interface.

## Recent Work

### **High-Performance Graphics** 
Built a multi-threaded fractal renderer in C, learning about parallel processing and optimization the hard way.

### **Web Security Analysis**
Solving CTF challenges in cryptography, web exploitation, and binary analysis. Each writeup documents what I learned.

### **API Integration Projects**
Creating tools that connect different systems, focusing on clean interfaces and error handling.

## Currently Learning

I'm working on improving my understanding of:
- Systems architecture and scalability
- Security-first development practices  
- Clean code principles and testing strategies

Every project teaches me something new. I document the lessons learned because explaining helps solidify understanding.
