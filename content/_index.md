# Hi, I'm Tham ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer in Paris. I came from ocean science and found I really enjoy solving problems through code.

Currently working with **Python** and **C++**. I like building things, breaking things (safely), and figuring out how systems work.

## What I'm up to

- **Systems Programming**: Learning C++ the hard way through graphics and networking projects
- **Security Research**: CTF competitions teach you to think like both builder and attacker  
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building complete applications from database to UI
