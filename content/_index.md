## A Digital Workbench

This site serves as my engineering notebookâ€”a live collection of projects I've built, problems I've solved, and things I'm learning. My background is in science, where I learned to model complex systems. Today, I apply that same curiosity to software.

I believe in learning by doing. Everything here, from the C++ rendering engines to the automated deployment of this site, is a product of that process. The source for every project is available on GitHub.
